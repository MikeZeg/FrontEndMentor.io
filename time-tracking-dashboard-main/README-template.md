### The Challenge

    Challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To complete the challenge users should be able to: 
        
        - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
        - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
        - Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
