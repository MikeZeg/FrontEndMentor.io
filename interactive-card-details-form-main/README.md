## The Challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Your users should be able to:
  - Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time,
  - Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
      - Any input field is empty,
      - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format,
  - View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size,
  - See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page.
